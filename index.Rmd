## Information About Tidyverse and Tidymodels
The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org) are big milestones in the R community for data manipulation, machine learning, and an overall workflow and ideology when programming in R. A big thanks to Hadley Wickham, Julia Silge, Max Kuhn, and all others that help the R community grow.
